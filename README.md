# She What?!

## Intro

Welcome Rulers,
 
I hope you are all doing well and also excited to dive into New Frontiers Format with 
the cards from the newest edition "Game of Gods: Reloaded". After a longer break from my side I finally 
found some time again to play some games and write another article for you. 
So here we go, this time I will introduce you to one of your new Rulers,
which is [Shiva, Providence of Nature]. 
Have fun with the deck profile and keep brewing with the new set :)

 	
## Shiva Goodstuff

Shiva is one of the two "Villain"-Rulers in Game of Gods: Reloaded and in my opinion it was the weakest 
one of the four new rulers I thought first. But my opinion changed after playing a few games and seeing 
how nice some of the cards synergize together. So I decided to share my first draft of this deck with 
you, to give you a first impression on how to build a Shiva deck.

Same procedure as last year (and last article) for this Deck-Feature. I will start with the decklist 
first, in case you want to build it and start playing right away. After showing you the list, we will 
take a look at the list in more detail and I will go over certain interactions and card choices.

## How to win	
The Deck is a mix of a control and a beatdown deck, which also is able to perform a 1 card infinite 
attack combo (more to that later). So we are quite flexible. One the one hand we can go for a big board 
and swing with Shivas +200/+200 field buff, which we get for ordering a resonator. While on the other 
hand we can also play more reactively and try to outcontrol our opponent until we can overwhelm him and 
win.

## Keycards and Playlines	
Since we are playing Shiva we can also run one of the best cards in this set in my opinion, which is 
[Rigveda]. Another powerful card, which we are also playing 4 copies of in the main deck is 
[Dark Alice in Ma'at]. [Flute, Captive Dragonoid Child // Group of Comets] and [Phantasmal Ascendant] help us to get ahead with our will production. 
[Tea Party Before the Decisive Duel] also gives us the option to get ahead of will in certain situations, while also giving cards like Alice and
[Misteltein Dark Sword Saint] quickcast to interrupt our opponents plays. 

[Melfee, Travelling Sorceress] acts as a color fixer, while also providing more bodies and therefore more attack to the board. [Odin Enters the Game of Gods] 
helps to dig deeper into the deck. Note that it to remove [Tea Party Before the Decisive Duel] as one of our three cards we take a look at, we are still able to return Tea Party to the graveyard, to recover a stone and draw a card and make our next Light resonator quickcast.

Another card that already saw play in [Fiethsing]/[Moojdart] mostly is [The First Boon: Excalibur Cassius, Sword]. It gives us three more cards that we can cast 
from the "removed from game" zone. Even though our opponent gets the information which cards that are, its more than worth it.

The rest of the cards act as supporters, like [Keep the Faith!] to revive a 1-will resonator, or [The Three Beast Warriors] as a way to interact with 
the opponents gameplan (Destroyng Alice Regalias for example).

The last two cards I want to go over a a bit more gimmicky. So lets skip right into our next section.
