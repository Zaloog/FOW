## Intro

Welcome Rulers,
 
I hope you are all doing well and also excited to dive into New Frontiers Format with 
the cards from the newest edition "Game of Gods: Reloaded". After a longer break from my side I finally 
found some time again to play some games and write another article for you. 
So here we go, this time I will introduce you to one of your new Rulers,
which is [Shiva, Providence of Nature]. 
Have fun with the deck profile and keep brewing with the new set :)

 	
## Shiva Goodstuff
Same procedure as last year. I will start with the decklist first, in case you want to build it and start 
playing right away. After showing you the list, we will take a look at the list in more detail and I will 
go over certain interactions and card choices.

## How to win	
The Deck is a mix of a control and a beatdown deck, which also is able to perform a 1 card infinite 
attack combo (more to that later). So we are quite flexible. One the one hand we can go for a big board 
and swing with Shivas +200/+200 field buff, which we get for ordering a resonator. While on the other 
hand we can also play more reactively and try to outcontrol our opponent until we can overwhelm him and 
win.

## Keycards and Playlines	
Since we are playing Shiva we can also run one of the best cards in 
this set in my opinion, which is [Rigveda].
