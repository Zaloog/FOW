# She What?!

## Intro

Welcome Rulers,
 
I hope you are all doing well and also excited to dive into New Frontiers Format with 
the cards from the newest edition "Game of Gods: Reloaded". After a longer break from my side I finally 
found some time again to play some games and write another article for you. 
So here we go, this time I will introduce you to one of your new Rulers,
which is [Shiva, Providence of Nature]. 
Have fun with the deck profile and keep brewing with the new set :)

 	
## Shiva Goodstuff

Shiva is one of the two "Villain"-Rulers in Game of Gods: Reloaded and in my opinion it was the weakest 
one of the four new rulers I thought first. But my opinion changed after playing a few games and seeing 
how nice some of the cards synergize together. So I decided to share my first draft of this deck with 
you, to give you a first impression on how to build a Shiva deck.

Same procedure as last year (and last article) for this Deck-Feature. I will start with the decklist 
first, in case you want to build it and start playing right away. After showing you the list, we will 
take a look at the list in more detail and I will go over certain interactions and card choices.

## How to win	
The Deck is a mix of a control and a beatdown deck, which also is able to perform a 1 card infinite 
attack combo (more to that later). So we are quite flexible. One the one hand we can go for a big board 
and swing with Shivas +200/+200 field buff, which we get for ordering a resonator. While on the other 
hand we can also play more reactively and try to outcontrol our opponent until we can overwhelm him and 
win.

## Keycards	
Since we are playing Shiva we can also run one of the best cards in this set in my opinion, which is 
[Rigveda]. Not only a Counter for cards, but also abilities or a simple destruction spell...and since we are playing Shive, 
we can choose more than one modes and pay only as much as the number of modes we chose. This also makes Rigveda a 1 mana Counter in Shiva decks, which is of course very strong.  
Another powerful card, which we are also playing 4 copies of in the main deck is [Dark Alice in Ma'at]. Not only does her enter ability let us remove cards from our opponents hand,
we also get a dark Regalia token, which we can rest to give another J-Ruler/Resonator -600/-600. So board and hand control in one card. 

[Dark Alice in Ma'at]. [Flute, Captive Dragonoid Child // Group of Comets] and [Phantasmal Ascendant] help us to get ahead with our will production. 
[Tea Party Before the Decisive Duel] also gives us the option to get ahead of will in certain situations, while also giving cards like Alice and
[Misteltein Dark Sword Saint] quickcast to interrupt our opponents plays.

[Melfee, Travelling Sorceress] acts as a color fixer, while also providing more bodies and therefore more attack to the board. [Odin Enters the Game of Gods] i
helps to dig deeper into the deck. Note that it to remove [Tea Party Before the Decisive Duel] as one of our three cards we take a look at, we are still able to return Tea Party to the graveyard
to recover a stone and draw a card and make our next Light resonator quickcast.

Another card that already saw play in [Fiethsing]/[Moojdart] mostly is [The First Boon: Excalibur Cassius, Sword]. It gives us three more cards that we can cast 
from the "removed from game" zone. Even though our opponent gets the information which cards that are, its more than worth it.

The rest of the cards act as supporters, like [Keep the Faith!] to revive a 1-will resonator, or [The Three Beast Warriors] as a way to interact with 
the opponents gameplan (Destroying Alice Regalias for example).

The last two cards I want to go over a a bit more gimmicky. So lets skip right into our next section.

## Infinite Attack Combo	
The two cards I am talking about is [Awakening of Grusbalesta] and [Arena Expansion: Mimi Tribe Festival]. Since we are playing Shiva, we have always acess to Mimi Tribe Festival,
because we are allowed to play it from our sideboard, if we revealed it at the beginning of the game. It can also be played for free, if we have a combined total of more than 3000 ATK on our side of the field.

On enter we can search for 2 Mimi Tribes, which also is nice, but the more important ability is that we can recover a stone everytime one of our resonators attacks.
Since Awakening of Grubalesta turns our stones to resonators, we can attack with them, which triggers the addition, recovers the attacker and lets us attack again.
So we can basically attack as often as we want, which should be enough to lower our opponents lifepoints to 0.

With 3 different Stones in play we can play the Awakening of Grubalesta for only one will and the 3000 Attack of the three stones is also (almost)
enough to play the Mimi Tribe Festival for free from the sideboard.

## Play Style	
Like I said before the deck is quite flexible. One of the best openings one can have is most likely Flute with an Rigveda and/or Tea Party in Hand. That way we can start with an will advantage,
while also having interaction available. 
In our second turn the best follow up would be a ordered Dark Alice to Steal two cards from our opponents hand while also building field presence 
and having potential removal with the darkness regalia token. 
From there on it depends, what our opponent is playing, but in general, we should try to get small amounts of damage in,
while keeping our opponent under control. When there is a possibility for a potential OTK, cause our opponent is tapped out, or we get the information about his hand cards from playing a Dark Alice,
we can try to win the game with the infinite attack combo. 

## Ending Words
I hope this list might give you a good starting point with Shiva for the upcoming NF-Format. There are of course more possible variants to play Shiva, like with Mimi Tribe cards for example, or
with the two cards [Rudra, God of Rampaging Winds] and [Agni, God of Rampaging Flames] which can get out of control real fast with that waste amount of +1 counters they generate, 
if your opponent does not deal with them quickly.

Have fun with this list and keep brewing :)
