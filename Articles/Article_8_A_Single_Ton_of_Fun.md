# A Single Ton Of Fun

## Intro
Welcome Rulers,
 
The new Set just dropped and as you might know, I have been a big fan of singleton rulers since Ayu back then in 2018.
With Game of Gods:Revolution we get the third singleton ruler after Ayu and Ragnarok, which is [Zeus, the First Olympian].
I have been playing with Zeus during the spoiler season quite a bit, so in this Article I will tell you about the experience 
I made with this new deck so far, as well as diving into some deeper strategies for him and also explaining the new mechanics he brings to the table.
Since Wanderer will be the official Tournament Format in the future, this deck-feature will also be for the Wanderer Format.
Enough for the introduction part, lets start climbing the stairs to the olymp.

I will start with the decklist, and in the following section, where I talk about the new mechanics and support cards and why 
I hesitate to play his full package of support cards.

## New Mechanics
With the new set Game of Gods Revolution, we also got the new [Union Seven \<Twelve Olympian Gods\>] mechanic, which I will refer to just as [Union Seven] 
for the rest of this article. Uff... another new mechanic you might think...
No Problem, lets take a quick look into the new CR and see how it works:  

1155.2. “[Union Seven <New Twelve Olympian Gods>] (Text)” means “This card gains
the following text in all zones as long as you control in public zones and own revealed
outside the game a combined number of seven or more New Twelve Olympian Gods
with different names."

As a short reminder, here is a short list for all public zones, where Tw you might thinkelve Olympian Gods count towards [Union Seven]:
- cards on the field
- cards in the graveyard
- cards in the "removed from game" zone
- cards revealed from sideboard (for example with [Origin of the 7 Lands])  
- cards in the ruler area

To set up [Union Seven] it takes quite a bit. But with the right cards, its possible on turn 2 or 3 already. 

## Zeus ,his Olympians and more support
Zeus is the first Singleton Ruler, that got so much support cards, that we will not have problems filling his remaining deck slots with good cards.
Also notice, that we are able to trigger most of the Non-[Union Seven] abilities of the Twelve Olympian Gods, when we reveal them with [Zeus] Enter ability, 
that triggers if we order a resonator or [Zeus Enters The Game Of Gods].
In the following Table I will shortly display the Twelve Olympian God cards and their abilities.
(only the reveal-trigger abilities and the union 7 ones, cause they are the most relevant)
