# A Single Ton Of Fun

## Intro
Welcome Rulers,
 
The new Set just dropped and as you might know, I have been a big fan of singleton rulers since Ayu back then in 2018.
With Game of Gods:Revolution we get the third singleton ruler after Ayu and Ragnarok, which is [Zeus, the First Olympian].
I have been playing with Zeus during the spoiler season quite a bit, so in this Article I will tell you about the experience 
I made with this new deck so far, as well as diving into some deeper strategies for him and also explaining the new mechanics he brings to the table.
Since Wanderer will be the official Tournament Format in the future, this deck-feature will also be for the Wanderer Format.
Enough for the introduction part, lets start climbing the stairs to the olymp.
