**Deck Tech Series**

# Atom Deus

## Intro
Hello again Rulers,
 
Here we go again with the second Deck Feature from the newest expansion.
This time I present to you: [Deus Ex Machina], one of our two Tales Rulers from our newest expansion 
"Game of Gods: Reloaded". You can also check out the first deck feature with Shiva [here].

## Atom Deus
This Deck will is a special take on an Atom deck, while not only taking advantage of playing machines,
but also having some mill capabilities to fill our graveyard faster with atoms. 
It might not be very competetive, but can surely catch people off guard 
(if they have not read this article). There are also some other nice interactions possible with the new 
cards, but we will go more into detail on those later, here comes the decklist first.
