**Deck Tech Series**

# Atom Deus

## Intro
Hello again Rulers,
 
Here we go again with the second Deck Feature from the newest expansion.
This time I present to you: [Deus Ex Machina], one of our two Tales Rulers from our newest expansion 
"Game of Gods: Reloaded". You can also check out the first deck feature with Shiva [here].

## Atom Deus
This Deck will is a special take on an Atom deck, while not only taking advantage of playing machines,
but also having some mill capabilities to fill our graveyard faster with atoms. 
It might not be very competetive, but can surely catch people off guard 
(if they have not read this article). There are also some other nice interactions possible with the new 
cards, but we will go more into detail on those later, here comes the decklist first.

## How to win	
The Idea of this deck is quite simple, we try to get 5 Atoms into your graveyard and win with [Bahamut]. 
There are some nice card interactions in here, which I believe will also be viable for other combo decks, 
but for this list I decided to focus around Atoms, also because [Tiny Violet] and 
[Violet, Flame of Procidence Distortion] are Machines, which can get their enter ability retriggered for
one blue will with [Knight of Knights].

## Keycards and Playlines	
Key cards besides our 2 Violets and Bahamut are cards that help mill cards. One of the best cards for that
job is [Titors Gimmick], which mills the top two cards of our deck. It also taxes our opponent cards,
they want to play with one extra will cost during our turn, which might be helpful to not get disrupted.

Another keycard is [Scheherazade, Weaver of Fairy Tales]. We can order her and tap our ruler to get 
a 1-cost resonator and addition at the same time from the deck. She will also turn into a machine,
thanks to Deus Ex's ability. So if we want to mill cards, we can fetch Titors Gimmick and Tiny Violet for
example. If we want to go more aggressive, we can take [Unity of the Machine Knights] to choose
Tiny Violet and Scheherazade, to make sure they dont get removed. Or if we want to go for the finishing
blow we can get [Altesing's Secret Hideout] to protect our board with [Spirit of Knowledge] to search
for Bahamut.

Lots of possibilities as you can see. And another nice trick is, that the game remembers,
that Scheherazade was awakened, so if we play [Knight of Knights] on her, we get the resonator and the
addition for only one will (if she is ordered and therefore a machine).

Another strong start with energize is the following: <br />
We order [Ayu, Multidimensional Wanderer] call a green stone and then cast an awakened Scheherazade.
She can then also grab the [Deep Blue Soldier] which can put a light regalia into the field, which we 
can use as a will-source thanks to Ayu. Soldier is also some kind of free discard fodder,
since it comes back to hand everytime a J-Ruler enters our field. 

In general Ayus and Soldier are in the deck, to generate card advantage, cause Ayu can still use her 
draw ability, even if she is not ordered. Another nice way to draw extra cards is
[Knowledge from the Future], which we can play for only one will from the sideboard, to draw
two cards thanks to our Ruler.


## Play Style
The Deck is more like a casual Combo Deck and the surprising face of your opponent, when you play Atoms
in Deus Ex machina, is always worth a try at locals. Try to hide your gameplan as long as possible.
The deck has the potential to get 5 Atoms or more to the graveyard (Remember you can also banish 
[Magic Stone of Atoms]) in a single turn and win with a Bahamut,
before your opponent even knows what your gameplan is about. Make use of that surprise effect.

## Ending Words
This deck is way more casual compared to the Shiva List before [Link]. But I wanted to also
present some less competetive decks for casual local play during this series too.

For the next Deck, we might move a bit more into the competetive realm again, and focus our attention
on another Villain ruler. Stay tuned.

Also good luck for everyone playing the Online GP next Weekend. Unfortunately I cant participate myself,
but maybe next time i can change that. Have fun and again good luck for the 5th/6th March.
