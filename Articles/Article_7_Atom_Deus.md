# She What?!

## Intro

Welcome Rulers,
 
I hope you are all doing well and also excited to dive into New Frontiers Format with 
the cards from the newest edition "Game of Gods: Reloaded". After a longer break from my side I finally 
found some time again to play some games and write another article for you. 
So here we go, this time I will introduce you to one of your new Rulers,
which is [Shiva, Providence of Nature]. 
Have fun with the deck profile and keep brewing with the new set :)
